# OrcaSlicer machine and filament settings

This document describes the OrcaSlicer settings used with the Creator 5
toolchanger, adaptive bed mesh, Prime Tower registration, and print-scoped Z
offsets in this change set.

The examples assume that the corresponding macros and Klipper extras from this
branch are installed on the printer.

`DEFINE_PRIME_TOWER_OBJECT`, `ADAPTIVE_MESH` and `ADAPTIVE_MESH_TOGGLE` are the
original project's macros now (see `UPSTREAM_STATUS_N4S4.md`). What this branch
adds to them is only `ADAPTIVE_MESH`'s `PLATE=` parameter (the build-plate
correction below), a hint to the toolchanger that a purge line follows the
first pickup, and the registration of the tower with the toolchanger; a start
G-code written for the original's macros works unchanged.

## Printer profile: machine start G-code

In OrcaSlicer, open:

**Printer settings > Machine G-code > Machine start G-code**

Use the following start G-code:

```

The `G1 E-5` pressure-relief block used by older revisions must be removed.
The deferred startup now leaves every tool parked until `ADAPTIVE_MESH` has
completed, so there is no mounted nozzle pressure to relieve. Keeping that
command could attempt a cold extrusion before a tool has been selected.

The firmware reads the leading `M140` target before the file starts and begins
bed heating before the initial `G28`. The normal startup callback deliberately
defers its second Z home, mesh handling, initial-tool pickup, and print-offset
setup to `ADAPTIVE_MESH`; this avoids homing and grabbing the same tool twice.

### Nozzle-dependent startup purge line

The start G-code selects the purge parameters from the nozzle diameter of the
initial tool:

| Nozzle | Line height `Z` | Total filament `E` | Stationary lead `LEAD` |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0.25 mm | 0.15 mm | 5 mm | 1.5 mm |
| 0.40 mm | 0.20 mm | 10 mm | 3 mm |
| 0.60 mm | 0.30 mm | 15 mm | 4 mm |
| 0.80 mm | 0.40 mm | 20 mm | 5 mm |

The diameter of every installed nozzle must be configured correctly in Orca.
This startup purge line uses `nozzle_diameter[initial_extruder]`, because it is
printed only for the initial tool. Subsequent tools are primed by the Prime
Tower during a multi-material print.

The divisor `2.4053` is the cross-sectional area in mm² of 1.75 mm filament
(`pi * (1.75 / 2)^2`). Dividing the filament profile's maximum volumetric flow
in mm³/s by this area and multiplying by 60 converts it to the filament feed
rate in mm/min expected by Klipper. For the 0.25 mm nozzle, the stationary
lead-in is additionally capped at 6 mm³/s to limit pressure in the smaller
nozzle.

`_PURGE_NEAR_OBJECT` normally creates a line up to 50 mm long (25 mm on each
side of its selected center). It may shorten the line to remain inside the
available build area, with a minimum length of 20 mm. `E` is the total filament
used by the macro: `LEAD` is extruded while stationary and the remainder is
extruded during the XY move.

Orca's **Printer settings > Multimaterial > Advanced > Preheat time** is the
source of all preheat scheduling. Orca emits an early `M104` when that lead
time fits inside printable G-code. For the first change, the requested lead
time can begin inside machine-start G-code, where no early `M104` can be
placed; that tool is then heated by Orca's `M104` and `M109` at the change.
(Branch `n4s4/fixes-and-optimizations-01` heated the second tool right after
the mesh; this branch dropped that, as the original did.)

### Prime Tower geometry

`DEFINE_PRIME_TOWER_OBJECT` must be emitted before `ADAPTIVE_MESH`. It adds the
active Prime Tower to Klipper's `exclude_object` geometry so the adaptive mesh
and the near-object purge line include it.

`DEPTH=` is intentionally omitted. Orca's start-G-code placeholders do not
provide a reliable independent tower depth. `ff_print.py` parses the active
plate's generated G-code and supplies the actual tower X/Y position, width,
depth, brim, rotation, center, and outline. The values passed by the start
G-code are compatibility fallbacks; if parsed depth metadata is unavailable,
the macro falls back to `DEPTH=WIDTH`.

This also avoids using a Prime Tower position belonging to another plate in a
multi-plate Orca project.

### Build-plate mapping

The start G-code translates Orca's display names to stable macro identifiers:

| Orca build plate | `PLATE` value |
| --- | --- |
| Smooth Cool Plate | `SMOOTH_COOL` |
| Cool Plate | `SMOOTH_COOL` |
| Smooth High Temp Plate | `SMOOTH_HIGH_TEMP` |
| High Temp Plate | `SMOOTH_HIGH_TEMP` |
| Textured Cool Plate | `TEXTURED_COOL` |
| Textured PEI Plate | `TEXTURED_PEI` |
| Structured PEI Plate | `TEXTURED_PEI` |
| Engineering Plate | `ENGINEERING` |
| Cool Plate (SuperTack) | `SUPERTACK` |
| Any unknown plate | `DEFAULT` |

The actual build-plate corrections remain printer-side in
`[gcode_macro _BUILD_PLATE_OFFSETS]`. For example:

```ini
[gcode_macro _BUILD_PLATE_OFFSETS]
variable_smooth_cool: 0.000
variable_smooth_high_temp: 0.000
variable_textured_cool: 0.000
variable_textured_pei: 0.030
variable_engineering: 0.000
variable_supertack: 0.000
```

Positive values raise the nozzle and reduce first-layer squish. Negative
values lower the nozzle and increase first-layer squish.

### Adaptive-mesh switch

The machine start G-code always calls `ADAPTIVE_MESH`. Its behavior can be
selected in Mainsail without changing or re-slicing the file:

```gcode
ADAPTIVE_MESH_TOGGLE ENABLE=1
```

probes a fresh adaptive mesh for the next print, while:

```gcode
ADAPTIVE_MESH_TOGGLE ENABLE=0
```

skips probing and loads the saved `MESH_DATA` profile. Display the current
selection with:

```gcode
ADAPTIVE_MESH_STATUS
```

The adaptive-mesh selection is session-local and defaults to enabled after a
Klipper restart.

## Filament profile: material Z offset

Open each Orca filament profile and select:

**Filament settings > Advanced > Filament start G-code**

Add one command containing that filament profile's correction. Current PLA
example:

```gcode
; Filament gcode
; PLA (default)
TOOLCHANGE_SET_MATERIAL_OFFSET VALUE=0.030
```

Create an independently calibrated value for every other filament profile,
for example:

```gcode
; Filament gcode
; PETG -- replace 0.000 with the calibrated value
TOOLCHANGE_SET_MATERIAL_OFFSET VALUE=0.000
```

Do not place this command in **Change extrusion role G-code**. It belongs to
the filament profile and is applied whenever Orca activates that filament.
Each tool in a multi-material job may therefore use a different material
offset.

`VALUE` is the absolute value of the material component, not an incremental
babystep. Repeating `VALUE=0.030` leaves the material component at `+0.030`;
it does not add another `0.030` on every tool change.

Positive values raise the nozzle and reduce squish. Negative values lower the
nozzle and increase squish. The accepted range is `-0.500` to `+0.500` mm.

## How the Z corrections combine

The print-scoped Z correction is calculated as:

```text
print Z = temperature + hot-bed + thin-layer + build-plate + material
```

Tool calibration (`nozzle_z - station_z` and per-tool `z_adjust`) remains a
separate part of each tool's coordinate frame. A live display babystep is also
kept separate, so neither ending a print nor replacing a material value erases
the operator adjustment.

With the current example values:

```text
Textured PEI build plate: +0.030 mm
PLA material profile:     +0.030 mm
Plate + material:         +0.060 mm
```

The nozzle therefore runs `0.060 mm` higher than the plate/material reference,
before the automatically calculated temperature, bed-temperature, and thin-
layer terms are included. At a 220 °C nozzle and with the current temperature
coefficient of `0.000450 mm/°C`, the temperature term is another `+0.045 mm`,
giving `+0.105 mm` total when the bed and layer terms are both zero.

This additive design lets the build plate be calibrated once with a reference
filament and each filament be calibrated once on a reference plate. Do not
copy the same physical correction into both components unless the combined
effect is intentional.

## Verification

After slicing, search the generated G-code for:

```text
DEFINE_PRIME_TOWER_OBJECT
ADAPTIVE_MESH ... PLATE=...
TOOLCHANGE_SET_MATERIAL_OFFSET VALUE=...
```

At print start, the Mainsail console reports the selected plate correction and
the complete print Z calculation. During a print, use:

```gcode
TOOLCHANGE_STATUS
```

to inspect the active print offset. `GET_POSITION` reports Klipper's normal
G-code/homing coordinate state and does not expose the separate toolchanger
transform, so a zero `gcode homing` value there does not mean these corrections
are inactive.
