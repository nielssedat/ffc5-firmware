# Print-start / print-end entry points for the FlashForge Creator 5 Pro.
#
# The stock slicer profile's start G-code carries no toolchanger information
# and no G28 -- its only motion is `G1 Z5 F2400`, which on an unhomed machine
# raises "Must home axis first". So the file cannot be what prepares the
# machine: something must home, clean and grab a tool BEFORE its first line,
# which is exactly what the touchscreen app did before sending M23/M24. This
# module restores that ordering for prints started from Moonraker/Mainsail by
# wrapping the commands that begin a print, so the stock OrcaSlicer profile
# needs no modification.
#
# NOT via idle_timeout:printing: that is emitted synchronously inside motion
# scheduling, which is no place to run a G-code script, and it fires only once
# the toolhead syncs -- which for a stock file is the very `G1 Z5` that fails.
#
# It contains no print policy. It resolves the file, reads the slicer
# metadata, and calls two ordinary macros defined in ff-print-macros.cfg:
#
#       FF_BEFORE_PRINT_START ORIGIN=<cmd> [BED=] [TOOL=] [NOZZLE=] [LAYER=]
#       FF_AFTER_PRINT_END    STATE=<complete|cancelled|error|...>
#
# Everything derived is also published in get_status as printer.ff_print.*.
#
# The command metadata comes from the head of the file. A bounded tail read is
# additionally used for Orca's resolved prime-tower settings:
#   bed          the first `M140`/`M190 S<t>`
#   nozzle       the first `M104`/`M109 S<t>`
#   first tool   the first bare `Tn` -- the file's initial extruder, NOT the
#                lowest-numbered one it uses
#   next tool    the second distinct bare `Tn`, plus its first `M109` target,
#                within the head of the file; this covers a preheat window
#                which begins inside start G-code
#   tools        all tools named by Orca's `; filament:` header (1-based in
#                that header), with a bare-Tn scan as fallback that gives up
#                after SCAN_BUDGET seconds
#   layer        the first `;HEIGHT:` -- the FIRST layer's height, which is
#                what the print Z offset's thin-layer term wants
#   prime tower  Orca's single resolved wipe_tower_x/y plus width/brim/rotation
#                values. In a multi-plate project the start-G-code placeholder
#                may incorrectly expand to the first value of a comma-separated
#                list instead of the active plate's single resolved value.
#
# Temperatures and tools are not read from the slicer's config block: those
# values can differ from the commands actually emitted. The sole exception is
# Orca's resolved prime-tower geometry. Its exact single-value entries are
# needed because a custom start-G-code placeholder can incorrectly expand to
# another plate's entry from a comma-separated multi-plate value.
#
# Per-tool clean temperatures are NOT taken from the file; the app's material
# table is ported as _FF_FILAMENT.temps, with the material per tool alongside.
