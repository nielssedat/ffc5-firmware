# Everything the mod installs lives in $MODDIR. What the printer READS is
# elsewhere, at absolute paths FlashForge's scripts and Klipper's config
# choose and we do not: app_startup.sh runs
# /usr/prog/PROGRAM/software/firmwareExe, which starts
# /usr/prog/klipper/start.sh. This is the seam -- one symlink per file, so
# $MODDIR stays the only place anything is installed and `apk upgrade` is
# enough to change what the printer runs.
#
# THE KLIPPER CONFIG IS THE ONE PLACE THAT IS COPIED RATHER THAN LINKED INTO,
# and it is not copied into FlashForge's directory. $CONFIG_DIR below is the
# mod's own config directory, seeded ONCE from the stock /usr/data/config and
# the only one klippy is ever pointed at afterwards. /usr/data/config is left
# exactly as the stock firmware last wrote it.
#
# WHY, because it is the whole reason this directory exists. /usr/data is the
# DATA partition: flashing a stock package rewrites /usr/prog and does not
# touch it. So every mod file this script used to put in /usr/data/config --
# a symlinked printer.base.cfg, the ff-*.cfg beside it -- outlived the mod. A
# printer flashed back to stock came up with its printer.base.cfg pointing
# into a $MODDIR that was no longer there, and Klipper refuses to start on an
# [include] it cannot resolve. There is no undo for that from inside the mod:
# nothing of ours runs during a stock flash, and the release that replaced
# stock's printer.base.cfg kept no copy to put back. Not writing there in the
# first place is the only version of this that works, and it makes going back
# to stock the no-op it looks like.
#
# ORDERING. This runs straight after the installer extracts the payload, and
# again from anvil-core's post-upgrade script on an `apk upgrade`. It cannot
# run earlier
# and the links cannot be shipped as files: on a first install they would
# dangle, and on an upgrade they would resolve to the payload being replaced.
#
# The targets under /usr/prog are left alone until then, on purpose. A release
# ships no software component, so /usr/prog/PROGRAM/software still holds
# FlashForge's version directory and their firmwareExe -- which is what
# app_startup.sh's watchdog restores from when a payload never lands. A
# wrapper with nothing behind it would sit there and never start a UI; their
# binary at least brings the printer up.

# ---- FlashForge's chelper ---------------------------------------------------
#
# klippy loads chelper/__init__.py for its cffi cdefs and dlopens c_helper.so
# beside it, so the two are one unit: their 1.9.7 declares
#
#     void extruder_set_pressure_advance(struct stepper_kinematics *sk
#         , double pressure_advance, double smooth_time);
#
# and ours takes a fourth argument. A stock flash restores c_helper.so, out of
# the chelper.tar in its software component, and nothing else in that
# directory -- not __init__.py, not the .c sources. A printer that took a
# release whose software component carried our klippy therefore ends up with
# our cdefs against their library, and their extruder.py calling it their way:
# "expects 4 arguments, got 3", at the first extruder, on a machine that has
# already been flashed back to stock and has nothing left to flash.
#
# THE SOURCES MATTER AS MUCH AS THE TWO FILES. Their __init__.py is upstream's,
# check_build_code and all: any .c newer than c_helper.so and klippy shells out
# to mips-linux-gnu-gcc, which no printer has. So the whole directory is put
# back, ours removed with it, and c_helper.so is touched last so it is the
# newest thing there.
#
# ONLY UP TO 1.9.7, which is the firmware this copy came off. A newer
# FlashForge release may ship a different pair, and overwriting it would plant
# the same landmine the other way round -- so an unreadable version or a newer
# one is left alone. The version is FlashForge's own: no package of ours ships
# a software component, so /usr/prog/PROGRAM/software still names theirs.

# know: printer.cfg is FlashForge's per-unit file and it includes siblings the
# mod neither ships nor parses -- printer.filament.cfg, printer.vibration.cfg,
# whatever a given firmware version put there. Copying the directory wholesale
# takes them all, including the SAVE_CONFIG block at the end of printer.cfg
# with the machine's calibration in it, so the mod comes up on the printer's
# own numbers rather than on a default.
#
# ONCE, and never again: after this, $CONFIG_DIR is the live config and
# $STOCK_CONFIG is left as the machine had it, untouched from here on.
# Re-seeding would overwrite an owner's printer.cfg with a stale one on every
# update. The one migration below removes FlashForge's DC24V_CTL output_pin;
# printer.base.cfg now owns that hardware as a heater_fan, and leaving both
# definitions would make Klipper refuse the duplicate eheaterboard:PA3 pin.
#
# The mod's own .cfg files are NOT copied: they are symlinked in below, so an
# `apk upgrade` changes what Klipper reads without going near this directory.
#
# MOONRAKER'S TWO ARE COPIED, when a previous release left them here. This is
# Moonraker's config directory too now -- it runs with
# `-d /usr/data/anvil-data`, and its config directory is <data path>/config --
# so a moonraker-custom.conf an owner wrote is theirs to keep and comes across
# with everything else. moonraker.conf rides along and is then overwritten by
# the installer with the version this release ships, which is what it is for.
#
# THE TEST IS printer.cfg, not the directory: a $CONFIG_DIR that exists but
# has no printer.cfg is a machine that never finished seeding, and it must
# seed on the next boot rather than stay half-configured for ever. printer.cfg
# is copied LAST and through a temp name, so it appears only once everything
# it includes is already beside it -- which is what makes this test mean
