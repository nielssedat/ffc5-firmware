# Creator 5 macro configuration. Nothing is compiled, and the encoder is
# anvil-ffmpeg's problem, not this recipe's.
#
# UPSTREAM'S scripts/install.sh IS NOT USED: it clones into a home directory,
# symlinks into a Moonraker checkout, appends to live config and registers an
# update_manager entry that re-clones over the network -- all of which this
# repo does differently. The tarball is just a source, and the two files it
# actually contributes are placed by hand.
#
# GitHub wraps the archive in moonraker-timelapse-<sha>/; the paths reach
# through that rather than hiding the archive's shape behind --strip-components.
